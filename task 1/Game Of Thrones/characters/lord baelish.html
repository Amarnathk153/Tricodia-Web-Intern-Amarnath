<p style="font-size:150%; color:#FFFFFF;">Brothel keeper and political dabbler, Baelish is among the best connected men in Westeros. He was introduced to viewers as Master of Coin on King Robert Baratheon’s Small Council and later conspired to assassinate horrid King Joffrey. Catelyn Stark was his one true love. He would later wed her sister Lysa Tully and push her to her death as she turned on Catelyn’s daughter Sansa. By dint of the marriage he is now Lord Protector of the Vale and regards Sansa as an ally he can woo.</p>
