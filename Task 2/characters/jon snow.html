A pensive soul,he joined the Night’s Watch and, ranging north of the Wall, fell in love with the Wildling Ygritte. When the Free Folk attacked the Wall, lovers become foes - though he was devastated when she was killed. Elected Lord Commander of the Watch he struck an alliance with the Free Folk against the Walkers. For that he was betrayed and assassinated by his own men - though later resurrected by Melisandre. Having defeated Ramsay Bolton before the Gates of Winterfell Snow is now King in the North.</p>
