<p><b>Daenerys Stormborn, Mother of Dragons, is perfectly placed to become ruler of Seven Kingdom. Daughter of the deposed Mad King Aerys,  she has an army, an armada and three dragons. Introduced to viewers as a trembling young woman, Daenerys has taken naturally to the Game of Thrones and is one of the most admired and feared rulers either side of the Narrow Sea. This owes a little to her cruel, imperious character and rather a lot to her power trio of fire-breathing lizards. </p>
