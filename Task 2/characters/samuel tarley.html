<p><b>The bookish scion of House Tarly has become Jon Snow’s clever-clogs best friend. While no warrior, his insights into the behaviour and motivations of the White Walkers have been of huge assistance. He is currently at the Citadel studying to be a Maester – though will surely return to Snow’s side at first opportunity. </p>
