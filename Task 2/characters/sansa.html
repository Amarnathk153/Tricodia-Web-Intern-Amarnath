<p><b>Initially a flighty teenager, Sansa has been forced to mature as she has watched her nearest and dearest cut down before her one by one. She has an uneasy relationship with Petyr Baelish, who long held a candle for her mother and appears drawn to Sansa also. On the other hand, he facilitated her marriage to the psychopathic Ramsay Bolton and is now trying to subtlety pit her against her brother Jon Snow. Sansa has developed a cruel streak, as confirmed when she fed Ramsay to the hounds. </p>
