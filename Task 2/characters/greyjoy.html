<p><b>Theon was raised at Winterfell and considered a brother to the ruling Starks in all but name. But his father Balon turned him against his adoptive family and he staged a botched invasion of Winterfell. He later fell into the clutches of Ramsay, who tortured and castrated Theon and forced him to take the name Reek. Fleeing with Sansa, he at last earned the respect of sister Yara and struck an alliance with Daenerys. </p>
