							<h2>Arya Stark </h2>
							<p class="title">Maisie William</p>
							<p>The feisty younger Stark sister, Arya saw her father beheaded and was at hand when her mother and brother (and sister-in-law) were cut down at the Red Wedding. She fled to Braavos, studying at the House of Black and White assassin’s guild. Returning to Westeros, she demonstrated how good she was at becoming "no one" when donning a disguise to get close to and kill Walder Frey, whom she holds responsible for the death of her family.<br>.</p>

							<h2>Bran Stark</h2>
							<p class="title">Isaac Hempstead Wright</p>
							<p>Poor little Bran was crippled and almost killed when flung from the top of a tower by Jaime Lannister. His crime: seeing the Kingslayer canoodle with his twin, Cersei. Bran has been haunted by visions and has the ability to project– or "warg’ – his consciousness into the body of an animal. Studying with the Three-Eyed Raven he has discovered the truth of Jon Snow’s parentage – his half-brother is, in reality, the child of Lyanna Stark.<br>.</p>

							<h2>Cersei Lannister</h2>
							<p class="title">Lena Headey</p>
							<p>The only daughter of Tywin Lannister and twin of Jaime. Cersei is cruel and vain – but her love of her children was genuine. As a young woman she was told by a witch that all her offspring would eventually wear "golden shrouds" – a prophecy which proved bloodily accurate. She endured an empty marriage with Robert Baratheon while romantically involved with Jaime, father of her children. Having eliminated her enemies when destroying the Great Sept, she sits upon the Iron Throne. But for how long?</p>

							<h2>Daenerys Targaryen </h2>
							<p class="title">Emilia Clarke</p>
							<p>Daenerys Stormborn, Mother of Dragons, is perfectly placed to become ruler of Seven Kingdom. Daughter of the deposed Mad King Aerys,  she has an army, an armada and three dragons. Introduced to viewers as a trembling young woman, Daenerys has taken naturally to the Game of Thrones and is one of the most admired and feared rulers either side of the Narrow Sea. This owes a little to her cruel, imperious character and rather a lot to her power trio of fire-breathing lizards.</p>

							<h2>Theon Greyjoy</h2>
							<p class="title">Alfie Allen</p>
							<p>Theon was raised at Winterfell and considered a brother to the ruling Starks in all but name. But his father Balon turned him against his adoptive family and he staged a botched invasion of Winterfell. He later fell into the clutches of Ramsay, who tortured and castrated Theon and forced him to take the name Reek. Fleeing with Sansa, he at last earned the respect of sister Yara and struck an alliance with Daenerys.<br><br>.</p>

							<h2>Jaime Lannister</h2>
							<p class="title">Nikolaj Coster-Waldau</p>
							<p>"Kingslayer" Jaime cut down Aerys II Targaryen before he could destroy King’s Landing with Wildfire. Jaime is mercurial and self regarding though with a sense of honour, as demonstrated when rescuing Brienne of Tarth from a bear fight. He was much diminished when he lost his hand to soldiers of House Bolton. He remains by Cersei’s side and nominally loyal – though clearly uneasy about her spiralling megalomania.<br>.</p>

							<h2>Jon snow </h2>
							<p class="title">Kit Harington</p>
							<p>The Bastard of Winterfell was introduced as the illegitimate son of  ruler of the North Ned Stark and an unknown mother. A pensive soul,he joined the Night’s Watch and, ranging north of the Wall, fell in love with the Wildling Ygritte. When the Free Folk attacked the Wall, lovers become foes - though he was devastated when she was killed. Elected Lord Commander of the Watch he struck an alliance with the Free Folk against the Walkers. For that he was betrayed and assassinated by his own men - though later resurrected by Melisandre. Having defeated Ramsay Bolton before the Gates of Winterfell Snow is now King in the North.</p>

							<h2>Lord Petyr Baelish</h2>
							<p class="title">Aidan Gillen</p>
							<p>Brothel keeper and political dabbler, Baelish is among the best connected men in Westeros. He was introduced to viewers as Master of Coin on King Robert Baratheon’s Small Council and later conspired to assassinate horrid King Joffrey. Catelyn Stark was his one true love. He would later wed her sister Lysa Tully and push her to her death as she turned on Catelyn’s daughter Sansa. By dint of the marriage he is now Lord Protector of the Vale and regards Sansa as an ally he can woo.<br><br>.</p>

							<h2>Eddard Stark</h2>
							<p class="title">Sean Bean</p>
							<p>Noble Ned was also Deeply Naive Ned and, appointed Hand of The King by Robert, found himself on the losing side of the Game of Thrones. The predictable winners were the Lannisters, whose boy-prince Joffrey ordered Lord Eddard of Winterfell beheaded before a baying mob.<br><br><br><br><br><br>.</p>

							<h2>Samwell Tarly </h2>
							<p class="title">John Bradley-West</p>
							<p>The bookish scion of House Tarly has become Jon Snow’s clever-clogs best friend. While no warrior, his insights into the behaviour and motivations of the White Walkers have been of huge assistance. He is currently at the Citadel studying to be a Maester – though will surely return to Snow’s side at first opportunity.<br><br><br><br>.</p>

							<h2>Sansa Stark</h2>
							<p class="title">Sophie Turner</p>
							<p>Initially a flighty teenager, Sansa has been forced to mature as she has watched her nearest and dearest cut down before her one by one. She has an uneasy relationship with Petyr Baelish, who long held a candle for her mother and appears drawn to Sansa also. On the other hand, he facilitated her marriage to the psychopathic Ramsay Bolton and is now trying to subtlety pit her against her brother Jon Snow. Sansa has developed a cruel streak, as confirmed when she fed Ramsay to the hounds.<br>.</p>

							<h2>Tyrion Lannister</h2>
							<p class="title">Peter Dinklage</p>
							<p>Clever and sensitive, Tyrion is an outlier among the Lannisters. He is a dwarf whose mother died in childbirth, for which he earned the enduring derision of Cersei and his father Tywin. However, Tyrion is also extremely intelligent and his tactical savvy was on display as he led the defence of King’s Landing at the Battle of The Blackwater. Wrongly accused of Joffrey’s murder, he was sprung from prison by Jaime, killed his father Tywin (who was sleeping with Tyrion’s lover Shae) and fled to Essos. There he has become counsellor to Daenerys Targaryen.</p>
