							<h2>Arya Stark </h2>
							<p class="title">Maisie William</p>
							<p>The feisty younger Stark sister, Arya saw her father beheaded and was at hand when her mother and brother (and sister-in-law) were cut down at the Red Wedding. She fled to Braavos, studying at the House of Black and White assassin’s guild. Returning to Westeros, she demonstrated how good she was at becoming "no one" when donning a disguise to get close to and kill Walder Frey, whom she holds responsible for the death of her family.</p>

							<h2>Bran Stark</h2>
							<p class="title">Isaac Hempstead Wright</p>
							<p>Poor little Bran was crippled and almost killed when flung from the top of a tower by Jaime Lannister. His crime: seeing the Kingslayer canoodle with his twin, Cersei. Bran has been haunted by visions and has the ability to project– or "warg’ – his consciousness into the body of an animal. Studying with the Three-Eyed Raven he has discovered the truth of Jon Snow’s parentage – his half-brother is, in reality, the child of Lyanna Stark.</p>

							<h2>Cersei Lannister</h2>
							<p class="title">Lena Headey</p>
							<p>The only daughter of Tywin Lannister and twin of Jaime. Cersei is cruel and vain – but her love of her children was genuine. As a young woman she was told by a witch that all her offspring would eventually wear "golden shrouds" – a prophecy which proved bloodily accurate. She endured an empty marriage with Robert Baratheon while romantically involved with Jaime, father of her children. Having eliminated her enemies when destroying the Great Sept, she sits upon the Iron Throne. But for how long?</p>
