Nice job!
Choose a good color theme.
Use good fonts which are available online.
Reduce the text content in the pages.If large text is present, give it a good font and display it using good fonts.
Try to give border for the boxes and divs.
Nice job on gallery. Scale the images to same size using photoshop before including them in the gallery.
